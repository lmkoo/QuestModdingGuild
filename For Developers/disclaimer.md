# Disclaimer

Before making mods, you should already have a understanding of C++ or at least some C#.  

If you don’t know either language, please don’t try to make a mod and then ask questions like:  
> *"Why do I get a error saying 'undeclared identifier' from your template?"*  

Also, don’t try to start with large games like Animal Company or the real Gorilla Tag. 
You won’t be able to make something like that.  

You can still make mods if you don't know anything about coding or making mods I don't care.
